Pacific Giant Salamanders, Dicamptodon tenebrosus, were surveyed in Oregon at the Andrews Experimental forest. The aquatic vertebrae study was sponsored and funded by the National Science Foundation's [Long-Term Ecological Research Program](https://portal.lternet.edu/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=knb-lter-and.4027.12) (Andrews LTER). Researcher Stanley V. Gregory began observing populations in 1993, continuing research into this day that has become one of the longest, uninterrupted studies of salamander populations recorded. In his surveys, Stanley observed Dicamptodon tenebrosus populations in two different settings, from which he gathered extensive data by weighing and measuring the salamanders.  

Evaluating populations from old growth forest and a clear cut forest invites several hypotheses that offer stark contrasts regarding the salamanders’ day to day survival. In a clear-cut forest, the cutting down of trees would lead to soil erosion and excess run off into creeks.  The lack of vegetation could have additional detrimental effects for healthy salamander populations, including a dwindling amount of hiding spaces with less vegetation.  All of this habitat destruction could have profound effects on biodiversity that would likely lead to a decrease in salamander population sizes and weights in clear cut forest.  In old growth forests, one would predict that salamander populations would be in a more stable environment, suggesting the population and weight of those samples would be more consistent and sturdy.


## 2. Data and methods

Data for Pacific Giant Salamander *Dicamptodon tenebrosus*, forest condition and location were collected by Andrews LTER. The Pacific Giant Salamander population was monitored in two standard reaches of Mack Creek: a clear cut forest (CC)  and an upstream 500 year old coniferous forest (OG).

The Pacific Giant Salamander abundance is sampled by specimens capture and with 2-pass electrofishing. The salamander samples were observed in the pool (p), cascade (c) and side channel (SC) of the creek. A group of specimens were observed in isolated pools (IP), but they are not included in this analysis.  For more information on collection methods, see [metadata](https://portal.lternet.edu/nis/metadataviewer?packageid=knb-lter-and.4027.13).

We employ an exploratory data visualization (historical evolution, distribution and general statistics analysis) of the Pacific Giant Salamander counts, weight and distribution. Through a Chi2 (α = 0.05), we evaluate if there is a significant effect of forest condition (CC or OG) on where the salamanders are located (P, C and SC). Then, with ANOVA tests (α = 0.05), we analyze the following questions:

- Is there a significant difference in mean weights for Pacific giant salamanders observed in the two forest sections (CC vs OG)?
- Is there a significant difference in mean weights for Pacific giant salamanders observed according to where they are found (C vs SC vs P)?

All the calculations and tests are performed by R software version 3.6.1.

### 3.1. Historical salamander abundance by forest condition

In 1993, both population counts started at almost the same level. However, between 1995 and 1999, the clear cut forest salamander decline was alarming. In the year 2000, even though both populations experienced a steep rise, the clear cut group experienced a greater surge considering their relative decline. Until 2014, both groups had similar fluctuations, but the old growth population dominated in number. However after the population fall of 2013-2014, the clear cut forest salamanders once again experience a notable increase, surpassing the old growth population.

The higher sample counts for clear cut forest salamander may indicate its resilience and adaptive capacity to differing habitats.

```{r}

#We add more format details to our figure 1
sala_graph1 + 
  theme(legend.position="top") + # We put the legend above the graphs
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0)) # We center caption to the left
```

### 3.2 Salamander abundance by location in the year 2017

Considering the rising abundance of both populations during 2017, we extend the analysis by including the locations where they are found (Figure 2). In the sample number of clear cut salamanders are higher than the old growth forest ones in the case of cascade (247 vs 201) and side channel (90 vs 74) locations. The opposite happens for pool location (30 vs 45) within the creek. 

```{r}
# We create a new table to keep location and forest section
classi_section <- mcreek_vertebrates %>%  
  filter(year==2017) %>% # Only for the year 2017
  filter(unittype %in% c("C", "P", "SC")) %>% # We dont include isolated pools (IP)
  count(section, unittype) # We count by forestion section and location

classi_section_table <- classi_section %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = section, values_from = n) # We pivot our table accordint to forest condition

classi_section_props <- classi_section_table %>% # We creater a proportions table
  adorn_percentages(denominator = "row") %>% 
    adorn_pct_formatting(digits = 2) 
 
colnames(classi_section_props) <- c("Location","Clear cut", "Old growth") # Format column names of proportions table
rownames(classi_section_props) <- c("Cascade","Pool", "Side channel") # Format column names of proportions table

# We create our final table included caption, column width and bootstrap striped
kable(classi_section_props, 
      caption = "Table 1: Number of salamanders by forest condition and location 2017") %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F)
```
Own elaboration

If we maintain the hypothesis about the species resilience and adaptability, the clear cut forest salamander is thriving as an opportunist ascertain itself in a new environment that presents less competition. However, this speculation goes against the reproductive lifestyle of this species: the Pacific Giant Salamander’s breeding ground are usually in stillwaters. If the resilience hypothesis holds true, it suggests the salamanders have modified its behavior switching to breed in running waters. Nevertheless, this conjecture fails to explain how the larvaes would manage to survive in a more hostile environment, especially when the absence of vegetation favors stronger currents.

The old growth forest salamander has a more evident presence in pools, their main reproduction habitat. Moreover, in old growth forests, there is less presence of soil erosion and more opportunities for pool/pond formation and greater variance terrain and habitat.It means the population surge in clear cut forests salamanders are temporary, as shown in the historical data (Figure 1). Without enough places to reproduce and hide (especially in the case of larvaes), it is expected that the clear cut population will diminish. 

### 3.3 Effect of forest condition on salamander abundance by location


```{r}

# We test chi 2 for evaluate independence between forest condition and location

# We extract the neccessary information from our table
salamander_chi_counts <- classi_section_table %>% 
  select(-unittype) # We dont keetp the column unittype

# We apply the chi 2 test
salamander_chi <- chisq.test(salamander_chi_counts)

#salamander_chi
```

Considering the discussion of the previous section, it is reasonable to test the effect of forest condition (clear cut and old growth) over the salamander abundance by where they are found. According to the results of the chi squared test, there is no significant association where the salamanders are found (cascade, pool and side channel) with the forest condition ($\chi^2$ (`r salamander_chi$parameter`) = `r round(salamander_chi$statistic,2)`, *p* = `r round(salamander_chi$p.value,2)`). 

It would be premature to draw broad inferences from this test, considering we are only evaluating the year 2017 and not the whole period of available data. With all things considered, this might not be the most meaningful interpretation of the data, given it is the longest continuous record of salamander populations.

                aes(x=section, ymin= mean_weight - sd_weight
                    ,ymax= mean_weight + sd_weight
                    ))

```


The salamander's weight doesnt present a normal distribution for any of the forest conditions (Appendix 1). However, the Leneve Test suggest we should retain the null hypothesis that weight  variances between forest sections are equal (p-value=`r round(sala_weight_s_leneve_p$pr_f,3)`, *p*<0.05). Considering its relative robustness even when the normality assupmtion does not apply, we will use the ANOVA test.

```{r}

# Anova test of salamander weight by forest condition
sala_weight_s_aov <- aov(weight~section, data=sala_section_weight_2017)

# summary(sala_weight_s_aov)

# We save our anova outputs
aov_outputs_s_c <- unlist(summary(sala_weight_s_aov))

```

According to the ANOVA test, the salamander's weight means across the forest sections (old growth and clear cut) differ significantly (one-way ANOVA, F(`r aov_outputs_s_c[1]`, `r aov_outputs_s_c[2]`) = `r round(aov_outputs_s_c[7],2)`, *p* = `r round(aov_outputs_s_c[9],10)`).

sala_side_cascade = t.test(lobster_2018_MPA$size_mm, lobster_2018_non$size_mm, paired=FALSE)

```


According to the ANOVA test, the salamander's weight means across the places where they are found (cascades, pools and side channels) aren't the same (one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey's HSD, F(`r aov_outputs_w_c[1]`, `r aov_outputs_w_c[2]`) = `r round(aov_outputs_w_c[7],2)`, *p* = `r round(aov_outputs_w_c[9],10)`). According to Tukey test, the only pair where the weight means dont differ significantly is between side channels and cascades (mean side channels= , mean cascades= , p-value = 0.16, *p*<0.05). On the other hand, the size effect is (Cohen’s d= `r abs(round(cohen_weight_c$estimate, 2))`).

## 4. Summary

- We can infer that the the rising population of clear cut forest salamander (Figure 1) signals the research opportunity on how some species are particularly suited to capitalize in niche environments that would otherwise appear hostile.
- Salamander populations are considerably adaptable, given that populations which existed in strikingly different environments experienced almost the same population fluctuations.
- There is no significant association between forest condition (old growth and clear cut) and the location where the salamander reside (casca, pool and side channel). However, research shows that salamanders reproduce in slow moving waters, which is supported by the old growth numbers (Table 1). In addition, the pool formation is more prominent in habitats with abundant vegetation.
